    "### BEGIN → the → fire → and → the → wind. → END\n",
    "### where ‘BEGIN’ and ‘END’ are special states for the beginning and the end of the sentence. To find the transition probabilities, we go over a large body of text and record current word and the next word. In the above example, ‘BEGIN’ is followed by ‘the’, and ‘the’ is followed by ‘fire’ and ‘wind’.\n",
    "### We won’t be computing actual probabilities. Instead, we create a dictionary that, for every word, contains all the words that follow it. To generate a phrase, we start at the ‘BEGIN’ state, and pick randomly one word from the list of words that follows the ‘BEGIN’ state. Then we look up which words follow that word, and again pick one word at random, until we hit the ‘END’ state, which signals that we are done.\n",
    "### Before you get started, download the starter code by using\n",
    "### $ git clone https://github.com/schmit/Markov-chain-startercode.git (if you have git / use Cloud9) or dowload the code directly: https://github.com/schmit/Markov-chain-startercode/archive/master.zip\n",
